# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project predicts heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. It includes data exploration, visualization, and machine learning modeling with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations:
  - Age vs Cholesterol scatter plot
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Boxplot of age distribution by heart disease
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis

## Models
- **Logistic Regression** (Accuracy: 91.67%)
- **Decision Tree** (Accuracy: 78.33%)

## Key Findings
- Top predictive features: `ca`, `thal`, `cp`, and `thalach`
- Strong correlation between `thal`, `ca`, and heart disease
- Logistic Regression outperformed Decision Tree

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the notebook or script to reproduce results

## Dataset
[Heart Cleveland Upload Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
